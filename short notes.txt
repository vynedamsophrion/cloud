AWS's Responsibility - manages and secures the infrastructure of cloud services. Like hardware, software, networking, and facilities.


Customer's Responsibility[in cloud security] - managing access controls, encrypting data, and configuring security settings.

APIs - enable communication between different software applications or services.

REST APIs:  using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

SOAP APIs: using XML for structured communication.

WebSocket APIs: Enable real-time, two-way communication.
 
		
		PRICING

Compute: Charges are based on the time resources are active (e.g., per hour or second for EC2 instances).

Storage: Costs depend on the amount of data stored (e.g., S3 storage pricing per GB).

Data Transfer: Outbound data transfer is charged, while inbound data transfer is typically free

 Pay-as-You-Go
 
 Pay Less by Using More

 Save When You Commit -  offers discounts if you commit to using specific services over 1 or 3 years


		IAM 

IAM -  control access to AWS resources

Root user - main user/account holder

IAM user  - users created by root user with no prior permissions

IAM policies in AWS are JSON documents that define permissions for actions on AWS resources

policy types 

	    >Identity-Based Policies - Grants permissions to identities.
	    >Resource-Based Policies - Attached directly to AWS resources (e.g., S3 bucket policies).
	    >Permissions Boundaries - Used to limit permissions for IAM entities
	    >Service Control Policies (SCPs) -  to limit permissions for IAM users and roles within accounts.
	    >Access Control Lists (ACLs) - Provide permissions for network access to resources.
	    >Session Policies - Used for fine-grained control over temporary credentials.





		SWITCHING ROLES

> create a user account > create a role in console of previous user > select the entity type > then add permissions
> copy the switch role link > give a display name > if not working change the resource into ARN id from console and paste it in create inline policy json editor  in user permissions policies and give a name to it. > click  on switch role.


IAM Identity centre (Single Sign-On) - a single point of control for managing user access to AWS resources and other cloud applications, including those within an AWS Organization.



			AMAZON EC2

Hypervisor - software layer that enables virtualization, allowing multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine.

Virtual Machine - allow you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine.

launch template - contains configuration information for launching EC2 instances.


Stateless app - do not store any user data 
Stateful app - Stores data related to user activity

Scaling up - upgrading resources to new bigger one
Scaling out - upgrading by replicating the existing


Instances - virtual server

Public Subnets - Internet-facing, accessible with public IP addresses, require an Internet Gateway.[web servers]

Private Subnets - Not directly accessible from the internet, require a NAT gateway for internet access.[backend servers]

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - logically isolated network within the AWS cloud.

EBS (Elastic Block Store) - scalable, high-performance block storage service designed for use with EC2 instances.

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - template that contains OS, apps, settings, storage.


Instances Types -
		  >General Purpose
		  >Compute Optimized - Designed for compute-intensive tasks like gaming servers and scientific modeling.
		  >Memory Optimized: High memory capacity for large databases and in-memory analytics.
		  >Storage Optimized: High disk throughput for big data and NoSQL databases.
		  >Accelerated Computing: GPU-powered instances for machine learning and graphics processing.
		  >High-Performance Computing (HPC): Optimized for complex simulations and modeling.

Snapshots -  point-in-time copy of an EBS volume used for backup and recovery, disaster recovery, data replication, and migrating data.

		

			

				Network interfaces in aws


Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) - enables network connectivity for EC2 instances.

Elastic Fabric Adapters (EFAs) - device that accelerates high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning applications.

Elastic Network Adapters (ENAs) - device that provides enhanced networking capabilities for EC2 instances.


 Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) - to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple targets

Typesw

>Application Load Balancer (ALB) -  smart traffic director for web applications. Works at the application layer (Layer 7)
>Network Load Balancer (NLB) - high-speed traffic controller for network connections. operates at the transport layer (Layer 4)
>Gateway Load Balancer (GLB) -  security checkpoint for network traffic. Helps manage third-party security appliances
>Classic Load Balancer (CLB) - Older version of AWS load balancers. It supports both Layer 4 and Layer 7 traffic but lacks advanced features.




		For Creating Auto Scaling Group

>create a launch template by adding user data in additional settings
>create a auto scaling group, select a launch template 
>select 2 AZ, then configure the settings 

 	 


Application Load Balancer -  distributes incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic across multiple targets.

2 Types 

Steps

>click Create load balancer >Select Application Load Balancer >Specify a name, scheme (internet-facing or internal), and IP address type 
>Choose subnets in the Availability Zones >Configure Security Groups >Set Up Listeners >Register Targets
>click Create Load Balancer > Access the load balancer's DNS name to verify traffic distribution.



Target Groups - a collection of backend servers (EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions) that a Load Balancer uses to distribute traffic.

Steps

>Choose Target Type >Enter a name, Specify the protocol, choose VPC, select IP address type.




The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) -  defines how network communication occurs in seven layers. 

OSI Model Layers in AWS:  [All People Seem To Need Data Processing]

- Physical Layer – Handles the transmission of raw bits over a physical medium (cables, fiber optics, wireless signals).
- Data Link Layer – data transfer between directly connected nodes. It manages MAC addresses, error detection, and frame synchronization.
- Network Layer –routing and forwarding data across networks. 
- Transport Layer – end-to-end communication between devices. It manages error correction, flow control, and segmentation.
- Session Layer – Help manage sessions between applications.
- Presentation Layer – Data representation and encryption.
- Application Layer – Provides network services directly to end users, such as (HTTP),(SMTP), and (FTP).




			VPC [Virtual Private Cloud]


Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network that is logically isolated from other networks in the AWS cloud, allowing you to launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

Security Groups - associated with individual EC2 instances and control both inbound and outbound traffic to and from those instances.

NACLs (Network Access Control Lists) - control traffic at the subnet level  support both allow and deny rules.

AWS VPN - a virtual, encrypted tunnel that works over public networks and connects to a network Quick to set up

AWS Direct Connect - Provides a dedicated, private connection to AWS.- More expensive and takes weeks to deploy






				S3 [Simple Storage Service]

Block Storage - stores data in fixed-size blocks, ideal for high-performance applications like databases and virtual machines.[EBS]

File Storage - Organizes data in a hierarchical structure with directories, best for shared access and enterprise applications.[EFS]

Object Storage - Stores data as objects with metadata, highly scalable and cost-effective for backups, archives, and big data.[S3]
