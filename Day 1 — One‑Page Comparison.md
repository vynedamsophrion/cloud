# &nbsp;		Day 1 — One‑Page Comparison 



&nbsp;Cloud Provider Comparison — AWS vs Azure vs GCP



&nbsp;Summary



AWS: Market leader with the broadest service catalog, mature tooling for enterprises and startups, strong serverless and managed database offerings, and the largest global footprint. 

Pricing: pay‑as‑you‑go, reserved instances, savings plans, free tier for many services.

Best for: widest ecosystem and global deployments.



Azure: Deep enterprise integration with Microsoft products (Active Directory, Windows Server, SQL Server), strong hybrid cloud tooling (Azure Arc, Azure Stack).

Pricing: pay‑as‑you‑go, reserved VMs, enterprise discounts.

Best for: Microsoft shops and hybrid scenarios.



GCP: Strong in data analytics, machine learning, and networking performance; clean developer experience and excellent Kubernetes support. Pricing: sustained‑use and committed‑use discounts. 

Best for: data/ML workloads and Kubernetes‑native projects.







\## Key Service Comparison

\- \*\*Compute\*\*: AWS EC2; Azure Virtual Machines; GCP Compute Engine.  

\- \*\*Serverless\*\*: AWS Lambda; Azure Functions; GCP Cloud Functions.  

\- \*\*Object Storage\*\*: AWS S3; Azure Blob Storage; GCP Cloud Storage.  

\- \*\*Containers / Kubernetes\*\*: AWS EKS; Azure AKS; GCP GKE.  

\- \*\*Managed Databases\*\*: AWS RDS/DynamoDB; Azure SQL/Cosmos DB; GCP Cloud SQL/Firestore.  

\- \*\*Monitoring / Logging\*\*: AWS CloudWatch; Azure Monitor; GCP Cloud Monitoring.







\## Pricing and Cost Controls

\- All three operate pay‑as‑you‑go and offer free tiers.  

\- Discount mechanisms: \*\*AWS\*\* (Savings Plans, Reserved Instances),

&nbsp;\*\*Azure\*\* (Reserved VM Instances, Hybrid Benefit),

&nbsp;\*\*GCP\*\* (Sustained‑use and Committed‑use discounts).  

\- Each provider offers cost management tools and budgeting alerts.







\## Global Reach

\- \*\*AWS\*\*: Largest number of regions and availability zones; ideal for low‑latency global deployments.  

\- \*\*Azure\*\*: Extensive region coverage and strong enterprise presence.  

\- \*\*GCP\*\*: Fewer regions than AWS/Azure but expanding rapidly; strong private network backbone.







\## Strengths and Typical Use Cases

\- \*\*AWS\*\*: Diverse workloads, enterprise migrations, startups needing rich services.  

\- \*\*Azure\*\*: Enterprises using Microsoft ecosystem, hybrid cloud requirements.  

\- \*\*GCP\*\*: Analytics/ML pipelines, Kubernetes‑first architectures, cost‑sensitive sustained workloads.







\## Recommendation Choose 

\*\*AWS\*\* for breadth and global presence.

\*\*Azure\*\* for Microsoft integration and hybrid needs.

\*\*GCP\*\* for data/ML and container‑native projects.

\## Reflection (5–7 lines)

I learned the core cloud characteristics and how public, private, and hybrid clouds differ. I can distinguish IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS by control and operational responsibility. AWS provides the broadest services and global reach, Azure excels at Microsoft integration and hybrid features, and GCP leads for data and ML. Pricing models are conceptually similar but discounts and commitment options differ by provider. The AWS Console felt feature‑rich and initially overwhelming; provider documentation will guide deeper tasks.
