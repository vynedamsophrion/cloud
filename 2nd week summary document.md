Over the course of this 5-day internship, I gained practical experience with core AWS services and developed a foundational understanding of cloud computing concepts. Each day focused on a specific area, combining conceptual learning with hands-on implementation.





##### &nbsp;	  Day-by-Day Learning Highlights



\- \*\*Day 1: Cloud Basics \& Platforms\*\*

&nbsp; - Learned the definition and characteristics of cloud computing.

&nbsp; - Compared AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud across features, pricing, and global reach.

&nbsp; - Created a free AWS account and explored the AWS Management Console.



\- \*\*Day 2: AWS Core Services\*\*

&nbsp; - Studied EC2, S3, and IAM.

&nbsp; - Launched a t2.micro EC2 instance, created an S3 bucket and uploaded a file, and set up a basic IAM user.

&nbsp; - Understood how these services interact to support scalable infrastructure.



\- \*\*Day 3: Networking \& Security\*\*

&nbsp; - Learned about VPCs, subnets, and security groups.

&nbsp; - Created a custom VPC with a public subnet and launched an EC2 instance inside it.

&nbsp; - Configured security groups for HTTP and SSH access, and wrote a security note explaining how the setup enhances isolation and control.



\- \*\*Day 4: Automation \& Monitoring\*\*

&nbsp; - Installed and configured AWS CLI for local automation.

&nbsp; - Used CLI to list EC2 and S3 resources.

&nbsp; - Created a CloudWatch alarm to monitor EC2 CPU usage and observed how real-time metrics can trigger alerts for performance issues.



\- \*\*Day 5: Static Website Deployment \& Presentation\*\*

&nbsp; - Designed and deployed a static website using S3 with public access.

&nbsp; - Enabled static hosting and added a bucket policy to make the site publicly accessible.

&nbsp; - Prepared a presentation summarizing the week’s learning, steps taken, and challenges solved.







###### &nbsp;	 Challenges Faced \& How I Solved Them



\- \*\*Remote Desktop Connection Error\*\*: Resolved by adjusting EC2 security group rules and verifying instance status.

\- \*\*AWS CLI Credential Issues\*\*: Fixed by running `aws configure` and setting environment variables correctly.

\- \*\*S3 Access Denied\*\*: Solved by applying a public-read bucket policy and enabling static website hosting.

\- \*\*CloudWatch Alarm Setup Confusion\*\*: Clarified CLI syntax and used a one-line command in Windows CMD to create the alarm successfully.







###### &nbsp;	 Key Takeaways



\- Cloud computing is powerful when paired with automation and monitoring tools.

\- AWS services like EC2, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch are highly customizable and scalable.

\- Security and access control are critical at every layer — from VPCs to bucket policies.

\- CLI tools and scripting can streamline cloud operations and reduce manual effort.

\- Troubleshooting is part of the learning process, and each resolved error deepened my understanding.
